# Basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript

* Create a wrapper with a width of 400px to set up the calculator.
* Determine how many rows and columns we need.
* Identify elements that occupy more than one column.
* Determine the HTML tags required to code rows and cells.
* Code a single row of 4 elements to start with and see if you can get that working.
* Now add the other rows of 4 elements.
* Finally, add the rows where there are fewer than 4 elements. What do you need to adjust to get these to work?
* Once your layout is mostly working, add the colors and make it pretty.
